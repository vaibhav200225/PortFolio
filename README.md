##Website Development

I have successfully developed and designed a dynamic and visually appealing portfolio website as a self-work project to showcase my skill set. Leveraging the power of React.js, I created a responsive website that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices, ensuring an optimal user experience.

Through meticulous attention to detail and a strong emphasis on creativity, I crafted a unique and engaging user interface, enhancing the overall user journey. The website's intuitive navigation and user-friendly layout allow visitors to explore my projects, experience my skills, and learn more about my professional background effortlessly.

In addition to the technical aspects, I ensured the website's performance was optimized, guaranteeing fast loading times and smooth interactions. Furthermore, by utilizing free hosting services, I made the website accessible to a wide audience, enabling easy sharing and showcasing of my work.

Overall, my portfolio website stands as a testament to my proficiency in React.js and web development. Its seamless responsiveness, creative design, and efficient hosting exemplify my dedication to delivering high-quality projects.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
